## üîê Security Considerations

This Telegram bot handles sensitive customer data and external integrations. Key security areas include:

### Telegram Bot Security

- Bot tokens are stored securely using environment variables
- Bot permissions are limited to necessary scopes only
- Message processing includes input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting prevents abuse of bot commands

### Database Security

- PostgreSQL connections use secure connection strings
- Database credentials are never hardcoded
- User data is stored with appropriate access controls
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

### Unthread API Integration

- API keys are stored securely using environment variables
- HTTPS/TLS used for all Unthread API communications
- Request validation ensures data integrity
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure

### Webhook Processing

- HMAC signature verification for all webhook requests
- Webhook secrets stored securely in environment variables
- Event validation prevents malicious payloads
- Redis queues are secured with authentication

### Environment Security

- All secrets managed through environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Support for encrypted environment configurations
- Secure defaults for production deployments

### Multi-Layer Storage Security

- Memory layer: Temporary data with automatic expiration
- Redis layer: Encrypted connections and authentication
- PostgreSQL layer: Secure connections with SSL/TLS support
- Data encryption at rest and in transit

## üè≠ Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

**Infrastructure Security:**

- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all webhook endpoints
- [ ] Secure PostgreSQL with strong authentication and encryption
- [ ] Secure Redis with authentication and TLS encryption
- [ ] Deploy behind a reverse proxy or load balancer
- [ ] Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation

**Application Security:**

- [ ] Set strong, unique bot tokens and API keys
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for bot commands
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs

**Operational Security:**

- [ ] Regular backups of PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Monitor for unusual bot activity or API usage
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Implement proper access controls for deployment
- [ ] Regular rotation of API keys and secrets

**Supply Chain Security:**

- [ ] Container images include SBOM and attestations
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning enabled
- [ ] Dependency updates managed through Dependabot
- [ ] Code signing and verification in CI/CD pipeline

## üîç Security Features

This project implements several security measures:

### Built-in Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information disclosure
- **Advanced Logging Security**: Built-in PII protection using [`@wgtechlabs/log-engine`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/log-engine) with automatic redaction of sensitive data
- **Access Control**: Proper permission checks for all operations

### Secure Logging with Log Engine

This bot uses [`@wgtechlabs/log-engine`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/log-engine) for enterprise-grade logging security:

**üîí Automatic PII Protection:**

- Passwords, API keys, tokens, and email addresses are automatically redacted
- 50+ built-in sensitive data patterns with zero configuration required
- Deep object scanning protects nested sensitive data
- Environment-based security configuration

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Features:**

- Custom redaction patterns for enterprise-specific data protection
- Content truncation prevents log bloat and data exposure
- Development-friendly debugging with secure production defaults
- Comprehensive audit trails with structured, secure logging

**üìä Example Secure Logging:**

```javascript
// Automatically protects sensitive data
LogEngine.info('User authentication', {
  username: 'john_doe',        // ‚úÖ Visible
  password: 'secret123',       // ‚ùå [REDACTED]
  email: 'user@example.com',   // ‚ùå [REDACTED]
  apiKey: 'key_123'           // ‚ùå [REDACTED]
});
```

This ensures that sensitive user data, API credentials, and other confidential information never accidentally appears in logs, even during development or debugging.

### Supply Chain Security

- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for all container images
- **Build Attestations**: Cryptographic proof of build integrity
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning with Trivy
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security patches

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to sensitive operations
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored
- **Secure Deletion**: Proper cleanup of temporary data
