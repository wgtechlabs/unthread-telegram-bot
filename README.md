**Official Unthread Extension** - The Unthread Telegram Bot is the official integration that connects your customer and partner Telegram chats with Unthread's ticket management system. Create and manage support tickets directly within dedicated Telegram groups, with real-time bidirectional communication between your team and clients.

Perfect for businesses managing customer support through private Telegram groups or partner channels - not for public community groups.

## ü§î How It Works

The **Official Unthread Telegram Bot** creates a seamless bridge between your customer/partner Telegram chats and Unthread's ticket management system.

### **üì• Ticket Creation**

- Customers and partners in dedicated group chats can create support tickets using the `/support` command
- The bot guides them through a simple conversation to collect issue summary and email (optional)
- Tickets are automatically created in Unthread with proper customer and user association

### **üîÑ Bidirectional Communication**

- **Agent ‚Üí Customer**: When agents respond via the Unthread dashboard, messages are delivered to Telegram in real-time
- **Customer ‚Üí Agent**: Customers can simply reply to agent messages naturally - no special commands needed
- **Status Notifications**: Receive real-time notifications when ticket status changes with clear messaging and emoji indicators
- **Conversation Flow**: Maintains complete conversation history across both platforms

### **üè¢ Smart Customer Management**

- Automatically extracts customer company names from group chat titles (e.g., "Company X Support" ‚Üí "Company X")
- Creates customers in Unthread with `[Telegram]` prefix for platform identification
- Maps Telegram users to Unthread user profiles with fallback email generation

## ‚ú® Key Features
