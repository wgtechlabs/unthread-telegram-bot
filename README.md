The Unthread Telegram Bot seamlessly connects your Telegram community with Unthread's powerful ticket management system. This official integration transforms how you handle support requests by enabling users to create and manage tickets directly within Telegram.

With simple commands and intuitive interactions, support tickets automatically sync between both platforms, streamlining your workflow and improving response times. Whether you're managing a community group, running a business chat, or supporting an open-source project, this bot provides the tools you need for efficient, organized customer support.

## ü§î How It Works

The Unthread Telegram Bot creates a seamless bridge between your Telegram group chats and Unthread's ticket management system. Here's how it works:

### **üì• Ticket Creation**
- Users in group chats can create support tickets using the `/support` command
- The bot guides them through a simple conversation to collect issue summary and email (optional)
- Tickets are automatically created in Unthread with proper customer and user association

### **üîÑ Bidirectional Communication**  
- **Agent ‚Üí User**: When agents respond via the Unthread dashboard, messages are delivered to Telegram in real-time through webhook processing
- **User ‚Üí Agent**: Users can simply reply to agent messages naturally - no special commands needed
- **Conversation Flow**: Maintains complete conversation history across both platforms using message reply chains
- **Webhook Server**: Powered by [`wgtechlabs/unthread-webhook-server`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/unthread-webhook-server) which processes Unthread webhooks and queues events in Redis for real-time delivery

### **üè¢ Smart Customer Management**
- Automatically extracts customer company names from group chat titles (e.g., "Company X Relay" ‚Üí "Company X")
- Creates customers in Unthread with `[Telegram]` prefix for platform identification
- Maps Telegram users to Unthread user profiles with fallback email generation

### **üíæ Multi-Layer Storage**
- **Memory Layer** (24h): Fast access for active conversations
- **Redis Layer** (3 days): Intermediate caching for recent activity  
- **PostgreSQL** (permanent): Long-term storage with full conversation history

## üîó Webhook Server Integration

This bot works in conjunction with the [`wgtechlabs/unthread-webhook-server`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/unthread-webhook-server) to enable real-time bidirectional communication. Here's how the complete system works:

### **üèóÔ∏è System Architecture**

```

### **üîÑ Event Flow**
1. **Agent responds** in Unthread dashboard to a ticket
2. **Unthread webhook** fires and sends event to the webhook server
3. **Webhook server** processes the event and queues it in Redis with proper formatting
4. **Telegram bot** polls the Redis queue and delivers the message to the appropriate group chat
5. **User replies** in Telegram, and the bot sends it back to Unthread API

### **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Requirements**
- **Webhook Server**: Must be deployed separately to receive Unthread webhooks
- **Shared Redis**: Both webhook server and bot must use the same Redis instance
- **Queue Names**: Both webhook server and bot use the standard queue name `unthread-events`

For webhook server setup instructions, see the [`wgtechlabs/unthread-webhook-server`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/unthread-webhook-server) repository.

- **Redis 6+** (optional, for enhanced performance)

### **Step-by-Step Installation**

#### **1. Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wgtechlabs/unthread-telegram-bot.git
cd unthread-telegram-bot
```

#### **2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Use Yarn only (npm not supported)
yarn install
```

#### **3. Create Telegram Bot**

3. Save the bot token for environment configuration

#### **4. Setup Unthread Integration**
1. Log into your Unthread dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Generate a new API key
4. Find your channel ID in the dashboard URL

#### **5. Database Setup**
```bash
# PostgreSQL (required)
createdb unthread_telegram_bot

# Redis (optional - for enhanced performance)
# Install Redis locally or use cloud service
```

#### **6. Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
nano .env
```

Required environment variables:
```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/unthread_telegram_bot

   ```
   [INFO] Database initialized successfully
   [INFO] BotsStore initialized successfully  
   [INFO] Bot initialized successfully
   [INFO] Bot is running and listening for messages...
   ```

2. Test basic functionality:
   - Add bot to a test group
   - Send `/start` command
   - Try creating a support ticket with `/support`
