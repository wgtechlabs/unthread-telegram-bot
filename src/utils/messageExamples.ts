// Example scenarios and their smart messages:

export const messageExamples = {
    
    // OLD APPROACH (generic, technical):
    old: {
        textOnly: "‚è≥ Adding to ticket...",
        withAttachments: "‚è≥ Processing files and adding to ticket...",
        mediaGroup: "‚è≥ Processing 3 files and adding to ticket..."
    },
    
    // NEW APPROACH (smart, user-centric):
    new: {
        // Text-only messages
        textOnly: "‚è≥ Sending your message to support team...",
        
        // Single attachments
        singleImage: "‚è≥ Sending your message and image to support team...",
        singleDocument: "‚è≥ Sending your message and document to support team...",
        singleVideo: "‚è≥ Sending your message and video to support team...",
        
        // Multiple attachments  
        multipleImages: "‚è≥ Sending your message and 3 images to support team...",
        mixedFiles: "‚è≥ Sending your message and 5 files to support team...",
        
        // Image-only (no text)
        imageOnly: "‚è≥ Sending your image to support team...",
        imagesOnly: "‚è≥ Sending your 2 images to support team...",
        
        // Different contexts
        ticketCreation: "üé´ **Creating Your Ticket**\n\n‚è≥ Sending your message and image to our support team...",
        agentReply: "‚è≥ Sending your response with document...",
        ticketReply: "‚è≥ Sending your message and 2 videos to support team..."
    }
};

// Benefits of the new approach:
export const benefits = [
    "‚úÖ User-friendly language: 'sending your message' vs 'processing files'",
    "‚úÖ Context-aware: distinguishes between images, documents, videos",
    "‚úÖ Natural counting: '2 images' vs '2 files'", 
    "‚úÖ Intent-focused: emphasizes communication, not technical processing",
    "‚úÖ Consistent across all contexts (creation, replies, agent responses)",
    "‚úÖ Single source of truth for messaging logic",
    "‚úÖ Easy to maintain and update"
];

// Technical implementation highlights:
export const implementation = {
    fileDetection: "Analyzes Telegram message types (photo, document, video, audio, etc.)",
    contentAnalysis: "Determines if message has text, attachments, or both",
    smartCounting: "Groups similar file types for natural descriptions",
    contextAware: "Different messages for ticket creation vs replies vs agent responses",
    fallbackSafe: "Graceful degradation if content analysis fails"
};
