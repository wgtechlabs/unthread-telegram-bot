# Security & Supply Chain

This project implements comprehensive supply chain security measures to ensure the safety and integrity of the codebase and deployments.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Supply Chain Security

- **SBOM generation** for all container images
- **Build provenance attestations** for transparency
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** with Trivy
- **Multi-layer security** from development to production

### Security Considerations

This Telegram bot handles sensitive customer data and external integrations. Key security areas include:

#### Telegram Bot Security

- Bot tokens are stored securely using environment variables
- Bot permissions are limited to necessary scopes only
- Message processing includes input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting prevents abuse of bot commands

#### Database Security

- PostgreSQL connections use secure connection strings
- Database credentials are never hardcoded
- User data is stored with appropriate access controls
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

#### Unthread API Integration

- API keys are stored securely using environment variables
- HTTPS/TLS used for all Unthread API communications
- Request validation ensures data integrity
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure

#### Webhook Processing

- HMAC signature verification for all webhook requests
- Webhook secrets stored securely in environment variables
- Event validation prevents malicious payloads
- Redis queues are secured with authentication

### Advanced Logging Security

This bot uses [`@wgtechlabs/log-engine`](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/log-engine) for enterprise-grade logging security:

**üîí Automatic PII Protection:**

- Passwords, API keys, tokens, and email addresses are automatically redacted
- 50+ built-in sensitive data patterns with zero configuration required
- Deep object scanning protects nested sensitive data
- Environment-based security configuration

**üìä Example Secure Logging:**

```javascript
// Automatically protects sensitive data
LogEngine.info('User authentication', {
  username: 'john_doe',        // ‚úÖ Visible
  password: 'secret123',       // ‚ùå [REDACTED]
  email: 'user@example.com',   // ‚ùå [REDACTED]
  apiKey: 'key_123'           // ‚ùå [REDACTED]
});
```

## üè≠ Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

**Infrastructure Security:**

- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all webhook endpoints
- [ ] Secure PostgreSQL with strong authentication and encryption
- [ ] Secure Redis with authentication and TLS encryption
- [ ] Deploy behind a reverse proxy or load balancer
- [ ] Implement proper firewall rules and network segmentation

**Application Security:**

- [ ] Set strong, unique bot tokens and API keys
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for bot commands
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs

**Supply Chain Security:**

- [ ] Container images include SBOM and attestations
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning enabled
- [ ] Dependency updates managed through Dependabot
- [ ] Code signing and verification in CI/CD pipeline
